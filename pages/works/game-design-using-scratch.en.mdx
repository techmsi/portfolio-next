  <div className="work-detail" data-id="12" data-disabled="0"
  data-featured="1" data-category="3" >
    Constructed Drupal site to host resources for educators that would like to teach game design. Authenticated users may view and add resources which other user's can flag if not useful and/or bookmark if useful. Additionally, approved users may ask questions that all users may view both the question and answer to.
The site uses the Panopoly distribution with a combination of other modules including but not limited to Views, Panels, and Flag. The site contains a custom theme based on Omega.
